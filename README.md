# FruitShop - Skill test for Asaitec

Points of interest to edit and use the proyect:
1. Example files (.csv format) have been given at the "entry-files" folder on this project.
2. The user must indicate the path to the mentioned archives to work with on the file "/src/main/resources/properties/config.properties". As can be seen on that file, those are fullpaths, not relative ones, please, keep it in mind.
3. Once setted the paths before, the user only has to run the main class at "/src/main/java/com/shop/main/Main.java".
